It's incredibly long, has a complicated plot, has about 75 characters to keep track of, and is written like a classic. So it's not the easiest read ever, but it's certainly not the worst. A story of love, loss, justice, revenge, pity, remorse, depression, strength, power, wealth, weakness, hope, trust, forgiveness, and betrayal. It's a book that has a little bit of everything where you're certainly rooting for Edmond for the entire journey." },

There's a character who walks around in the woods, a character who walks around a city, a character who LIMPS around a city, and a character who walks around a desert. These characters all eventually meet up with a few other characters and eventually converge on one another where the proceed to have some conversations about things happening in the world. Eventually, there's some action sequences in the last 1/6th of the book and overall sets up a very strong foundation for the rest of the trilogy (I assume). However, as a book, it's just a bit ... okay. I shouldn't complain, it's a perfectly fine fantasy story, just feels like a huge setup which is lackluster unless you continue the trilogy.", seriesOrder: 1 },

It has sort of a low-point about 2/3rd through the book but thankfully it picks up again for a good ending. No major complaints beyond a weird fixation from the author on the potential homosexuality of humanity (not a joke).", seriesOrder: 1 },
    {title: "Devolution", author: "Max Brooks", genre: "Thriller", rating: 4, dateFinished: "2024", pages: 288, category: "Fiction", format: "Audiobook", isBookClub: false, review: "Pure comedy - I did not expect this book to be as funny as it turned out to be. The premise of bigfoots attacking a remote (and stranded) neighborhood probably doesn't sound funny, but the execution certainly is. The book is told very seriously, and very realistically however there are some things that I just could not get over. Like the fact that nobody in the story owns a single tool of any kind (why would they?) Also I don't know if it was on purpose but Brooks made every character a total stereotype in one way or another which added to the humor. Overall, a highly highly entertaining story. Just don't take it too seriously!" },
    {title: "Termination Shock", author: "Neal Stephenson", genre: "Sci-Fi", rating: 3, dateFinished: "2024", pages: 720, category: "Fiction", format: "Audiobook", isBookClub: false, review: "I've read a lot from this author, this was possibly one of my least favorite. It's well written, and in theory the premise of the book is interesting...but it sort of falls apart toward the end. It's also a very slow burn, so that's a bit rough. Very good character development, except one character is sort off in their own universe the whole book until the very end when you go \"oh that's what that character was in the book for\" and it... it's not a good reason. If you wanna read Stephenson pick another of his books first." },
    {title: "The Gentleman In Moscow", author: "Amor Towles", genre: "Historical Fiction", rating: 3, dateFinished: "2024", pages: 465, category: "Fiction", format: "Audiobook", isBookClub: false, review: "This was actually a rare DNF turned \"Finished\" from 2020 where I stopped reading as I became \"bored with the story\"...this time I approached the book on audible and was able to get through it. Unfortunately, it was still somewhat...boring? The book is written very well and the author is clearly very talented, it reads a bit like a biography of a real person which is impressive considering it's fictional, albeit historic fiction. It's a novel about resilience and perseverance, good and evil, love, kindness, and compassion, togetherness and loneliness, ingenuity and bravery, and ultimately the slow march of time. There's potentially a lot to unpack in a novel like this, and I can see why it's held in high regard by many. Unfortunately for me, I just needed a few more Michael Bay explosions to hold my SciFi addicted attention I guess. I did finish it, and the ending was excellent so I can't complain." },

They're all...bad? I mean they're all about 5 minutes long but almost immediately I realized every story just was written for a quirky little twist ending that sort of made it less fun than it should have been for some reason. Given the low time investment required it's fine but also not something I'd go out of my way to recommend. Ignore the 0/5 as I'll rate each on their own.\n* Access - C, just sort of silly\n* Antihypoxiant - B, pretty fun actually\n* Annie's Day - A, my favorite of the collection for no reason\n* The Real Deal - F, meh\n* Bored World - C ,it's fine I guess\n* The Midtown Butcher - C, again, silly\n* Meeting Sarah - F, meh\n* The Chef- F, meh\n* The Egg- B, the title story is good if not a bit of an overplayed concept" },

The biggest issues is the book suffers from convenient writing constantly having you say \"oh really it worked perfectly just like that, huh?\" and is often a bit hard to believe what is happening. Second, all of the characters are 17-20 years old or so, but their dialog and skills sets would lead you to believe they are 35+ and grizzled war veterans or something of the sort. Bit unusual...still, not bad.", seriesOrder: 1 },

Writing is excellent. The characters all suck, none of them have any redeeming qualities what-so-ever which makes it a painful book. It's a unique approach to the usually overdone \"end of the world\" books you run into. Unsure if I'd pursue the sequels.", seriesOrder: 1 },

A novel about \"superheroes\" of a sort, but more like the show \"Heros\" on NBC back in 2016 where \"Ordinary people around the world discover they have super powers.\" but with a darker twist.

I expected a first contact story about hyper-evolved octopus being basically alien creatures. You do get that, but it's buried beneath a vague dystopian/scifi setting, scientists exploring the octopus as slow as possible, an android, corporations doing corporation stuff, a guy trapped on an AI ship, and a mind-hacker being chased by government spies or something. That all probably sounds cool but it's just straight up not? Most of the side storylines just feel irrelevant to the overall story. It's pacing is slow, it's setting is weird, it's just a strange book that I honestly didn't enjoy very much." },

Authority was a very different novel from Annihilation. I liked it just as much, but if Annihilation was a SciFi, adventure, thriller this was more like a bureaucratic, mystery, thriller?

It's not a bad book per se, and the differing points of view provides some much desired back-story and explanation to questions left unanswered from the previous two books.

Simmons adds his own twist to the story that adds an oppressive layer of suspense and horror to the novel, and I especially appreciated how well he was able to blend these historic and fictitious events. The result is a novel full of cold, dread, and misery. It's not exactly \"scary\" but undeniably grim. It's a hell of a journey, and I would recommend this book to anyone.\n\nThe characters in The Terror are well-developed and believable. The reader can feel the fear and desperation of the crew as they are trapped in the Arctic. Simmons does an excellent job of creating a sense of claustrophobia and isolation, and he makes the reader feel as if they are right there with the crew, experiencing everything they are experiencing. It is a story about survival, hope, and the human spirit. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, horror, or adventure stories." },

Miller does an excellent job of weaving together the threads of mythology and creating a believable and relatable character.\n\nCirce is a complex and fascinating character. She is strong, independent, and intelligent, but she is also vulnerable and flawed. She makes mistakes, but she learns from them and grows as a person; ultimately finding her own inner strength.

I think it plays around with a lot of ideas: hope, artificial intelligences, consciousness, ethics/morals, and in a very basic way the value of sunshine and fresh air.\n\nThe book has a very interesting narrator and gives you an unusual perspective on the events that unfold in the book. The book deals with spirituality, ensoulment (having a soul), ship of Theseus, cliques/social structures/caste, and AI ethics as well. One of my favorite aspects of the book is how things are mentioned in passing but never elaborated upon. That might sound frustrating at first, but the fact that the story is told from the perspective of an AI with a very limited view on reality makes this okay. The fact that we are never directly told a bunch of seemingly important details about the world we are in also helps pull you into a world that seems to have depth in all sorts of areas that are simply left up to the readers imagination." },

Don't read this an expect not to find spoilers.\n\nI found the theme of bullying someone who is different, or \"other\" to be very interesting in this novel. The blackwoods, especially Merricat are certainly \"different\" both in personality, and in economic status from the rest of their village. As a result, they are relentlessly bullied and eventually attacked. The theme of morality for the treatment of those who are different, either good or bad, hits home when at the end of the book all the same villagers pay their apologies with food delivered to their doorstep - a sign of regret and a lame attempt at an apology/seeking atonement.\n\nI found the dichotomy between merricat as a protector and Constance as an extremely shy and socially-terrified individual interesting - it's even shown on the cover as merricat stands behind a visibly afraid Constance.\n\nI suspect based on some of merricats devotion to touch, unwillingness to clean herself, inability to cook for herself, made-up rules that she applies to herself, routines and rituals, propensity to self-isolate in the woods, or lash out with destructive behavior, when confronted with a new situation, and general paranoia that she may be a character who has a form of autism. It's not often I find a character with traits like that in a novel, and found it fascinating to read. \n\nFor a long time I was perplexed as to why merricat poisoned her whole family - except constance who she clearly has a deep love for. I think there's an indirect theme here of both sexuality and abuse? It is mentioned several times that constance is a beautiful girl, and that the girls father was a \"wicked\" man, and while not explictly called out, I suspect the motivation merricat had for killing her family was to protect constance from further abuse from her father, any any of the family members that enabled that abuse without stopping it. This theme of a man taking advantage of the girls is once again replayed as Charles enters the story and, without any true care for anyone in the household, pursues their family wealth for himself - ultimately abandoning them during a crisis and worrying about money instead of Uncle Julian as he dies in the fire.\n\nThe ending was a charming way to tell the story of how a small-town urban legend about a pair of \"witches\" in a terrifying and obviously haunted looking house might form...and they were happy on their moon - laughing at those afraid of them who keep them at bay with donations of food." },

I almost put it under DNF, I probably skimmed over 1/3rd of the pages as it was so take that as you will. This is considered a \"Classic\" so I thought it would be good, and the underlying bones of the story are good. Unfortunately, the story is buried under a ton of unnecessary detail that bores you until the point that you literally have to stop reading or else risk falling asleep on the spot. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone to be completely honest. The book feels like a chore to get through which is a shame. If this book were updated to modern standards of story telling (without unnecessary made up lists and figures of statistics and scientific classifications) it might actually be good. However, we have to take it as face-value for the 100+ year old novel it is, and that novel did not age well." },

It's a good book, albeit slightly more \"boring\" than I was anticipating. The book is somewhat ruined (in my opinion) by an extreme excess of quotes. Since the book was published in 1972 all the quotes range a bit, but none of them really \"fit\" into the novel since it mostly takes place in 2025...so having quotes dated from the 1960's being dropped into the story in 2025 is...unusual? It was really taking me out of the novel so I literally started skipping the quote \"blocks\" in the story.\n\nSeriously, they should publish a copy of this that doesn't have any of those weird quote sections in it. Maybe one or two quotes at the beginning of a chapter, but there's dozens of pages of JUST quotes. Very strange.\n\nThe book itself is thought provoking, and despite spanning ~100 years in the story itself, the author did fairly well to avoid specifics that wouldn't age well (Eg. the computer \"Room\") which we all know would be a cellphone well before 2025. Anyway, despite that, It's a decent read and not terribly long so worth your time if you're interested in first contact style stories. (Just don't expect it to be about Aliens - it's 99% about humans)." },

I'd tried to start this once before, and stopped within chapter 1 in maybe ~2018/2019. Admittedly, the movie helps ease you into this novel. It's a book full of made up words that are unique to the Dune universe. So having a movie as background material to introduce you to characters, concepts, and putting something visual to text helps make the book a bit more approachable. I enjoyed the movie, and I enjoyed the book even more. Excellent read! Now I'm pretty excited for part 2 of the film. Not sure I'll continue with the series, though.

It was pretty good, but overall I'm not sure how I feel about it. The story follows a planet, Hyperion, and a mythical god-like murder creature there called the Shrike. There's a group of diverse characters who embark on a journey to meet the Shrike because the Shrike is getting more...murdery. Additionally there's some interstellar drama occurring between the Hedgemony (Humans), TechnoCore (a sentient AI faction), and some Ousters (weird humans) who want to go to war over the Shrikes house - the Time Tombs - which are some empty tombs that travel backwards through time. \n\nDid I lose you yet? Yes, there's a lot happening here. Possibly more than in Dune, actually. The book follows the journey of the characters as they approach Hyperion and the Time Tombs. Each of them tells their \"background story\" and that's 90% of the book. I enjoyed most of the stories equally, although perhaps one or two stood out. Overall, it just felt a bit...messy. Some of the stories had details that just seemed irrelevant to the overall plot perhaps. Maybe that gets more revealed in the second book..or the 3rd, or 4th.\n\nI felt the ending was a bit rushed and unsatisfyingly cliff-hangery.", seriesOrder: 1 },

I found my self glossing over pages of material that were just not interesting or useful to the main plot. Something interesting would be happening for a few pages only to be interrupted with strange tangents on greek gods and cereal. These added nothing to the story other than to needlessly pad the page lengths. This could have been a 5/5 book if the plot was tightened up slightly and the pages less filled with useless detail. Additionally, novels that alternate chapters between two sets of characters I often find disjointing if the chapters are not long enough. These chapters were in fact, too short, so the whole novel felt oddly stapled together. It was fine, and some of it was downright good.

Glad I took the time to read this one, even though Biographies aren't my normal choice. Interesting, depressing, enlightening. It slows down in the last 1/3rd, but that almost normal since biographies follow the path of someone's life, and life tends to slow down in the last 1/3rd I think? Regardless, super good.

It was a good start to the book.\n\n\"Exhalation\"\nMy favorite story out of the whole book. Maybe it's the authors, too, because he named the book after it.\n\n\"What's Expected of Us\"\nCool little story on free will. I thought it was fine for what it was.\n\n\"The Lifecycle of Software Objects\"\nThis was the longest story of the book, and I wish it wasn't. It's not that it wasn't interesting, but it dragged on before it really got to the point/theme/moral. It was intertwined with weird themes about growing up, humanity, sexuality, and romance. I sort of wish this was replaced with 3 smaller stories about different subjects.\n\n\"Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny\"\nFor some reason this reminded me of 'Amnesia: Justine' but I'm not sure why. It was fun to read, if not a bit strange?\n\n\"The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling\"\nSort of reminded me of \"Things Fall Apart\" somehow. Interesting look at how society shapes what we consider truth.\n\n\"The Great Silence\"\nIf I recall, it was like 3 pages long. It's good, but nothing to write a review about.\n\n\"Omphalos\"\nMaybe my least favorite in the whole book. It wasn't engaging for me, and I found myself bored until the end.\n\n\"Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom\"\nI enjoyed this one a lot. The concept of the prisms was interesting, and for a short story the character development was impressive." },

Where to start exactly? \n\nThis book is chaotic. The first half is harder to read than the second half due to every chapter being interrupted by a fairy tale / story. These stories do eventually loop back to the main plot - sort of. The book is ultimately confusing, and I found the conclusion generally unsatisfying. There were a lot of things that were brought up that seemingly had very little impact on the overall plot. \nThe plot structure was wildly non-standard. The main character was sort of dry. Most of the material was cool in premise, but felt like it was included because the author came up with a list of things she found cool and decided to try and write all of them into a single novel. The result is a little disjointed, and has a lot of convenient writing throughout. \nWhy did X happen at time Y? Because the author said so and it was cool, and we can use magic to explain anything anyway so no need for any real logic or flow. The book had some literary vibes: Alice in Wonderland, InkHeart, Inception (That's a movie but whatever). Lots of pop culture references - almost too many. Will date the book in 10 years. It felt like the author was trying really hard to make the book relatable. She didn't need to do that - just write an interesting story and it will be relatable. The ending was also vague (in my opinion) and left me with more questions than answers. This is bad for what I assume is a standalone novel (no sequels coming) - especially in a book that begins with questions without answers. So the whole book is sort of just a giant question mark. The book felt a bit overwritten - perhaps longer than it deserves. \n\nI'll give it 2.5 stars instead of 2 because at least the world building and visual descriptions were sort of interesting/fun. Anyway, not something I'd personally recommend to someone, but certainly appeals to certain folks more than me." },
